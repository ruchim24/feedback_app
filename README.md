A <b>Feedback Collector</b> Web Application in making!!!

I have named my application, as Emaily!
This is a feedback collector web application using which user will be able to create a survey and send it to bunch of emails and can collect feedback on that survey in a simple <b>yes/ no</b>.
For creatng a survey, we will be charging some amount of money to the user and will be providing them with some credits, using those credits user can create a survey.

<b>TECH STACK</b>

This application is being built using <b>Node.Js</b> for backend, <b>MongoDB</b> for database, <b>PassportJs</b> for authentication and <b>React</b> and <b>Redux</b> for frontend.
This will be hosted live on Render very soon once I complete its implementation.

<b>P.S.</b> It is a side project I am working on based on a tutorial!!
